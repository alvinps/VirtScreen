Create a 20-intel.conf file:

sudo vi /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf

Add the following configuration information into the file:

Section "Device"
    Identifier "intelgpu0"
    Driver "intel"
    Option "VirtualHeads" "2"
EndSection

This tells the Intel GPU to create 2 virtual displays. You can change the number of VirtualHeads to your needs.

Then logout and login. You should see VIRTUAL1 and VIRTUAL2 when you run xrandr.

Note if you were using the modesetting driver previously (which is the modern default) switching to the intel driver will cause the names of displays to change from, eg, HDMI-1 or DP-1 to HDMI1 or DP1.
